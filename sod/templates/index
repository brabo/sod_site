<title> SOD - Scanner for Open DNSs </title>
<h1> What is it? </h1>
<p><font size="5"><pre>SOD is a tool to scan the entire internet for open/recursive DNS servers.
It's a server/client, of which the server hands out /24 subnets to the clients,
the clients then nmap the range on port 53, for every positive result it
then tests what reply it sends, and uses that to determine wether it is open/recursive.
The server then geo-ips the results to city level, and stores everything in a database.

Off course, scanning the entire /0 is a lot of legwork, this is why we are
looking for participants in this experiment.
If you feel like participating, please feel free to have a look at the code
at <a href="https://github.com/GlobalShellz/sod">our Github repo</a>.

Running the client shouldn't be too hard, once cloned, './sod.thinpack.pl sod.gshellz.org'
should try to install the needed perl dependencies in a subdir of the project,
and run it. Once connected, you will see it doing its work.

We're still working on a real site, which will offer statistics as well as forms
to query the live database.
Once that's finished, there will also be a download link to a daily updated db.
